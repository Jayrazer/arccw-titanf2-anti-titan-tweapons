# Unique Projectile Behavior:

- Archer: Lock-on, no safety fuse. Cannot lock onto players or NPCs, only vehicles.

- MGL: Explode on set fuse, like a thrown grenade, but will impact-detonate if we hit a player or vehicle. Hitting a surface will kill most of the nade's momentum.

- Softball: Sticky grenades, explode on a set fuse. Fuse starts only after we've stuck onto something.

- EPG: basically just a dumbfire rocket but its plasma lol

- Sidewinder: Small, fast dumbfire rockets with small blast and damage.

- Thunderbolt: Slow-moving plasma ball, damages things in a radius around it as it flies, detonates on impact. Basically the Doom BFG.

- Cold War: Not so much projectile behavior, more weapon behavior. Impact grenades, fired in three-round bursts that require a charge-up before firing
